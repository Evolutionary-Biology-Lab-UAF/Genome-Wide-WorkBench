# üåê Genome Wide WorkBench (GWW)

**An integrated, offline, cross-platform platform for multi-omics analysis**  

Genome Wide WorkBench (GWW) unifies essential genomics and proteomics tools into a single desktop application.  
It eliminates fragmented workflows, costly licenses, and internet dependencies, empowering researchers ‚Äî especially in resource-limited environments ‚Äî to perform advanced bioinformatics analyses fully offline.
